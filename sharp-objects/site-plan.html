      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My website will sell 3D prints online. This will give a site that is easy to navigate and see product availability.
         My local customers can view products and place orders for free pickup. I can also gain new customers because I 
         can now reach an audience outside of the area where I live with this site. People will come to my website because
          I will make toys and decorations that are rare and unique. I will also make it cheaper than competitive prices. 
          For example, an infinity cube on Amazon costs around 8 dollars, and I will drop mine to 6 dollars. 
          I will also sell new types of infinity cubes with different options like glow-in-the-dark, glitter,
           color-changed, and wood filament. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My audience will be mainly children and Parents. For children, I will make some fidget toys such as infinity cubs and
         spinners, flexi toys, and more. For parents, I will make useful tools like back scratchers, decorations for holidays,
          and jewelry for women to wear. I want my 3-D prints to be all sorts of things for families.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will give a quick introduction to the website. First, it will have a quick banner about the website. 
        Then, it will summarize what the website and business does. Next, there will be a few products to show some of the
         products I have. Finally, I tell them that I have custom orders. There will be a few shortcut buttons leading to 
         the other pages if they are interested in it.

      </ul>
      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>
        People from all over the world can see and visit my website to place an order or look at the products I have 
        available to sell. They should be able to look through all the products and the prices for each 3D print listed. 
        I also want them to see what is in stock. I also want them to be able to click on the product and see more information, 
        such as a detailed description, multiple photos, and the different types of filament options for that product. I want 
        them to see all the products easily, find the one they want, and know how to order it. I also want them to leave reviews 
        to help tell others about my products and customer service. The review will also help me fix any issues with my business 
        or website. Customer feedback from reviews will help me improve the product.

      </ul>
      <h3>Product Order Page</h3>
      <p>
        I want the order button on each product slide to send them to the order page and automatically add the product to the order. 
        This will make it quick and easy for the customer to make purchases. They will only need basic responses to order a design 
        or product: their name, email, and how they want to get the 3-D print. Then they hit order, which sends the information to 
        my business email. 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Custom Order page</h3>
      <p>
        Another thing I am giving my customers is an option for a request for their own designs they want me to print or make. For 
        example, if they want a dragon or something they want, they could ask me to design it and print it. I would first make it 
        and then send an image through the email listed on my site. If they like and want it, I would print it and sell it to them. 
        If they do not like it, I will do my best to change it to how they like it. They could send me a file or image to design 
        the thing. That gives them an option to get exactly what they want. 

      </p>
      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Page</h3>
      <p>
        The contact page is for any issues or questions people may have. All they need to do is type their name, the reason for
         the message, and the message itself. They would hit the send button, and then I would respond to the question.
